<h3 style="margin-left: 325px;">What is this Web Application?</h3>
<p style="max-width: 800px; margin-left: 130px;"> This project was designed to be an independent study, overseen by Dr. Babcock. The
main objective of this web application is to experiment and play with Spring Boot, which I will use in my future
    job after college.
The purpose of this application is to be a box office predictor of some sorts. I'm an avid movie watcher and I enjoy
watching the box office numbers and seeing what movies are going to reach the top of the box office (I was disappointed
    to see MI
    Dead Reckoning only got 551 mil at the box office). Seeing these massive movies
    with big budgets flop at the box office lead to me question if there was a way to predict box office revenue.
I always see articles that 'predict' that a movie will open with '50 million' opening, and I was curious to see
if executives had some algorithm that I didn't know about.</p>
